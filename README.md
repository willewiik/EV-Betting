# EV-betting
A preview of my program that detects odds outliers on the odds provider Kambi by comparing their odds with those from Pinnacle.  

When predetermined criteria are met (minimum EV, maximum odds, minimum limit, etc.) a telegram message is sent out. 
Right now it takes about 0.6 seconds to compare a single match.
